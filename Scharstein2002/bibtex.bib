abstract     = {<p>Stereo matching is one of the most active research areas in computer vision.
                While a large number of algorithms for stereo correspondence have been developed,
                relatively little work has been done on characterizing their performance. In this
                paper, we present a taxonomy of dense, two-frame stereo methods. Our taxonomy is
                designed to assess the different components and design decisions made in
                individual stereo algorithms. Using this taxonomy, we compare existing stereo
                methods and present experiments evaluating the performance of many different
                variants. In order to establish a common software platform and a collection of
                data sets for easy evaluation, we have designed a stand-alone, flexible
                C++implementation that enables the evaluation of individual components and that
                can easily be extended to include new algorithms. We have also produced several
                new multi-frame stereo data sets with ground truth and are making both the code
                and data sets available on the Web. Finally, we include a comparative evaluation
                of a large set of today's best-performing stereo algorithms.</p>},
